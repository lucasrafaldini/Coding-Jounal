## Social Media

I'm not the kind of _Social Media Guy_. Honestly, I think Social Media turned into some kind of current open tv. Thereafter, it's users are turning into _open tv spectators_. But that is just my opinion, don't even mind that.

Anyhow, I can't stop writing and reading, so nevertheless you can find me at [Medium](https://medium.com/@lrafaldini) and [GoodReads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/86762812-lucas).
